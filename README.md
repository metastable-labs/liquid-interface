# Liquid Interface

React Native app for Liquid, a protocol for Liquidity and best yield aggregation.

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. We're using [Bun](https://bun.sh) as package manager, make sure you have it installed on your machine.

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   bun i
   ```

3. This project uses [Expo development builds](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction). Make sure you have these tools:

   - [Android Studio](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?platform=android&device=physical&mode=development-build&buildEnv=local#set-up-an-android-device-with-a-development-build)
   - [Xcode](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/?platform=ios&device=physical&mode=development-build&buildEnv=local#set-up-an-ios-device-with-a-development-build)

   Then, trigger a local app compilation with the following commands:

   ```bash
   # Build native Android project
   bun run android
   # Build native iOS project
   bun run ios
   ```

4. Start the metro bundler:

   ```bash
   bun start
   ```

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
